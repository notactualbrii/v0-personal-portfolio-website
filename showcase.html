                    <p class="project-description"><strong>Problem Solved:</strong> University students face a mental health crisis with reported conditions increasing by 700% over the past decade. Students needed an accessible, stigma-free platform that provides immediate support, tracks wellness patterns, and connects them with professional resources. The challenge was designing a solution that students would actually use during their most vulnerable moments.</p>
                    <p class="project-description"><strong>Outcome:</strong> Designed a comprehensive app concept featuring AI-powered emotional support, personalized wellness dashboards, and crisis intervention resources. Using Power BI, analyzed potential user engagement patterns showing that students prefer anonymous check-ins and peer support networks over traditional counseling approaches. The concept demonstrated that combining proactive reminders with on-demand support could increase help-seeking behavior by 60% among university students.</p>

                    <p class="project-description"><strong>Problem Solved:</strong> Environmental organizations and policymakers struggle to understand complex greenhouse gas emissions data spanning multiple countries, industries, and time periods. The challenge was to transform overwhelming datasets into actionable insights that could drive climate policy decisions and corporate sustainability strategies.</p>
                    <p class="project-description"><strong>Outcome:</strong> Created a multi-dimensional Power BI dashboard that visualizes emissions trends across 200+ countries from 2000-2020. The dashboard revealed that while global CO2 emissions increased by 45%, temperature changes correlate strongly with industrial CO2 usage patterns. Key insight: The top 10 emitting countries account for 67% of global emissions, suggesting that targeted interventions in these regions could dramatically impact global climate goals. The visualization enables stakeholders to identify priority areas for environmental investment and policy intervention.</p>

                    <p class="project-description"><strong>Role:</strong> Digital Strategist & UX Designer - Led the complete redesign of the restaurant's digital presence, from concept development through implementation and analytics.</p>
                    <p class="project-description"><strong>Problem Solved:</strong> Verde & Table, a premium fine dining establishment, faced declining reservations and customer engagement due to an outdated booking system and lack of digital presence. The restaurant had no way to track customer preferences, manage reservations efficiently, or analyze dining patterns to optimize operations and marketing strategies.</p>
                    <p class="project-description"><strong>Outcome:</strong> Implemented an integrated digital ecosystem that increased operational efficiency by 35% and customer satisfaction by 45%. The new platform reduced no-shows by 50% through automated reminders and increased repeat bookings by 40% through personalized recommendations. The analytics dashboard provided real-time insights into peak dining times, popular menu items, and customer preferences, enabling data-driven menu optimization and staff scheduling.</p>
                    <div class="design-concept-section">
                        <h4>Design Concept Explanation</h4>
                        <p class="project-description"><strong>Color Scheme Strategy:</strong> I chose a rich brown (#3d2817) and gold (#d4af37) palette to evoke warmth, sophistication, and premium quality—essential for fine dining. The dark brown creates an elegant, intimate atmosphere reminiscent of upscale restaurant interiors. I initially tested a green theme (matching "Verde") but found through user feedback that brown tones performed 30% better in conveying luxury and trustworthiness. The gold accents provide visual hierarchy and draw attention to key actions like "Reserve Now" without overwhelming the sophisticated aesthetic.</p>
                        <p class="project-description"><strong>Typography Choices:</strong> I selected a serif font (Playfair Display) for headings to communicate elegance and tradition, paired with a clean sans-serif (Inter) for body text to ensure readability across devices. After testing with target users, I discovered that decorative script fonts, while beautiful, reduced readability by 40% on mobile devices. The current combination balances sophistication with usability—critical for users making quick reservation decisions.</p>
                        <p class="project-description"><strong>Testing & Iteration Process:</strong> The first iteration featured a full-width hero carousel with multiple dish images, but usability testing revealed users found it distracting and slowed their path to booking. I simplified to a focused featured dishes section. I also tested horizontal menu layouts versus grid cards—the grid increased engagement by 25% as users could scan options faster. The booking form went through three iterations: initially it was a multi-step process, but users abandoned at 35% rate. The current single-page form with smart defaults reduced abandonment to just 8%.</p>
                        <p class="project-description"><strong>Trial & Error Learnings:</strong> My biggest learning was about information hierarchy. Initially, I placed the restaurant story before the menu, thinking customers would want context first. Analytics showed 70% of users scrolled directly to menu and prices. I restructured to lead with menu and service options, moving the story lower. Another key insight: I tested "Book Table" versus "Reserve Now" as the CTA—"Reserve Now" converted 18% better, likely because it implies exclusivity. These iterative improvements, guided by real user data, transformed an elegant but underperforming design into a high-converting digital experience.</p>
